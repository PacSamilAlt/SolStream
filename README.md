# Protocol
The current payment system inculcates a fixed pay scale for employees, freelancers, etc. However, there is no consideration for real-time accommodates, performance ratings, and individual contributions. Our DApp, "SolStream" enables the user to manage his finances in real-time. It ensures users get paid based on their contribution to the product and real-time performance assessment.
